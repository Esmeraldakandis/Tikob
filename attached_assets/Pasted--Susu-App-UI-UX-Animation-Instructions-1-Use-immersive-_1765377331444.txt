# Susu App UI/UX Animation Instructions

1. Use immersive, 3D or layered motion design — NOT flat 2D transitions.
   - Implement parallax scrolling, depth layering, and orbiting elements.
   - Avoid generic fade-ins or slide-ins.

2. Sidebar Profile Design:
   - Circular avatar bubble with soft glow.
   - Floating bubbles for badges, flags, and age.
   - Animated badges (pulse, shimmer, orbit).
   - Flag bubble should animate (wave effect).
   - Contribution counter ribbon with live ticker animation.

3. Chat Portal:
   - Threads = “Cycles” with animated transitions between states (Start, Midpoint, Harvest).
   - Voice notes appear as floating constellations (animated stars).
   - Reactions use custom emojis with motion (bounce, ripple).
   - AI emoji forge: generate and render custom icons dynamically.

4. Motion Principles:
   - All elements should feel fluid and ritualized (like spaace.io).
   - Use easing curves (ease-in-out, spring physics).
   - Bubbles orbit or drift slightly, simulating constellations.
   - Background gradients animate subtly (waves, palm leaves, stars).

5. Current Events Tab:
   - Animated cards that slide in with depth.
   - Geo-aware updates with flag icons and cultural overlays.
   - Action cards trigger animated group rituals (round-ups, donations).

6. Dynamic Logo Theming:
   - Haitian coat of arms as base logo.
   - Auto-overlay seasonal/holiday themes (lights for Christmas, lanterns for Lunar New Year).
   - Animated transitions between themes (fade, ripple).

7. Compliance & Savings Logic:
   - Group type picker adjusts rules automatically (Sol, Esusu, Njangi, Partner, etc.).
   - Each type has its own animated suite (different badge styles, payout animations).
   - International tax logic displayed with animated infographics.

8. General UX Standards:
   - Prioritize immersive storytelling over static UI.
   - Every transition should feel metaphorical (cycles, harvests, constellations).
   - Respect Lackou aesthetic: fluid, poetic, culturally rich, emotionally intelligent.
