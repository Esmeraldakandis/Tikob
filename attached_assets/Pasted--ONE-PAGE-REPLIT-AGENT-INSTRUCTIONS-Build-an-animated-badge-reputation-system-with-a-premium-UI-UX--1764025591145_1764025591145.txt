✅ ONE-PAGE REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
Build an animated badge reputation system with a premium UI/UX inspired by Framer, plus an interactive financial assessment survey and SUSU duration customization. The design must look professional, modern, and immersive—not basic or flat. Include the following:

UI/UX Requirements

Glassmorphism card design with blur and transparency.
Gradient progress bar for reputation score.
Premium typography (Inter or Poppins).
Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
Metallic badge icons (gold, silver, platinum) for high-tier badges.
Micro-interactions: hover scale effect on badges, smooth fade-in animations.
Confetti animation when a new badge is earned.
Animated glow around badges for premium feel.
Immersive survey experience with animations, transitions, and progress indicators (users should feel “oooo ahhhh” when interacting).


Animations

Use Framer Motion for:

Card fade-in and slide-up on load.
Progress bar animated fill.
Hover scale effect on badges.
Smooth transitions between survey questions.


Add subtle transitions for text and icons.
Include confetti effect when unlocking badges.


Badge System Logic

Generate badges dynamically based on user data:

Consistency Badge: Never missed a payment streak (e.g., 10+ weeks).
High Roller Badge: Weekly contribution ≥ $350.
Loyalty Badge: Active for 6+ months.
Elite Badge: Reputation score ≥ 80.


Display badges with names and icons.
Reputation score should be numeric and visual (progress bar).

Show a summary screen with recommendations after completion.


SUSU Duration Customization

Display duration clearly on the dashboard.
