**I built TiKòb - a fintech platform for community savings groups (SUSU/Tontine/ROSCA)**

Millions of people worldwide participate in traditional rotating savings groups. I built a modern platform to digitize and enhance these practices.

**Key highlights:**

- Double-entry ledger system with bank-grade financial accuracy
- 12 languages with AI-powered translations (Gemini AI)
- Supports 10+ cultural traditions (Susu, Tontine, ROSCA, Chama, Pardna...)
- Beautiful Haitian "Lakou" design aesthetic
- Tax reporting with automatic 1099-INT generation
- Gamification: badges, streaks, XP, and leaderboards
- Built with Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, and Plaid integration

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11 | Flask | PostgreSQL | Gemini AI | Plaid | 37 passing tests

This project combines my passion for fintech, cultural heritage, and modern web development.

**Introducing TiKòb: A Fintech Platform That Honors Cultural Savings Traditions**

Around the world, millions of people participate in community savings groups - known as SUSU in West Africa, Tontine in France, ROSCA in academic literature, Chama in Kenya, Pardna in Jamaica, and many other names. These traditions represent collective financial wisdom passed down through generations.

I built **TiKòb** (Haitian Creole for "savings box") to bring these practices into the digital age while preserving their cultural essence.

**What makes TiKòb special:**

1. **Fintech-Grade Financial Infrastructure**
   - Double-entry bookkeeping with immutable event sourcing
   - Decimal precision with banker's rounding
   - Time-weighted interest allocation
   - Automatic 1099-INT tax report generation

2. **Cultural Authenticity**
   - 12 language support with AI-powered accurate translations
   - Real-time AI-generated Haitian proverbs
   - 10+ cultural savings traditions supported
   - Beautiful "Lakou" design inspired by Haitian village life

3. **Engaging User Experience**
   - Custom Haitian coat of arms with historical elements
   - Gamification with badges, XP, streaks, and reputation
   - Light/dark mode with smooth transitions
   - Mobile-responsive glassmorphism design

4. **Enterprise Security**
   - Login blocking after 5 failed attempts
   - CSRF protection and security headers
   - Rate limiting and password hashing
   - Plaid integration for secure bank linking

**Why I built this:**

The Haitian proverb says "Ansanm nou pi fò" - Together we are stronger. This project reflects my belief that technology should amplify cultural wisdom, not replace it.

Community savings groups have helped families buy homes, start businesses, and weather financial storms for centuries. TiKòb makes this tradition accessible, transparent, and secure for the modern world.

**Technical deep dive:**
- 37 comprehensive tests covering financial logic
- Double-entry ledger passes all accounting requirements
- SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
- Google Gemini AI for translations and proverbs
- Flask-Talisman for security headers
